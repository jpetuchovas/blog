Yesterday, I got my acceptance letter to Georgia Tech’s [Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). This, coupled with the fact that I had enough time today to set up this blog, nudged me to finally start blogging so that I could share my experience of the OMSCS program in the future. I may also write about my preparation for the program.

I will start studying in January 2020 and most likely specialize in computing systems, taking courses such as [High-Performance Computer Architecture](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6290-high-performance-computer-architecture), [Operating Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6210-advanced-operating-systems), and [Algorithms](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms).

Of course, this blog will not just be about OMSCS. I intend to write about software engineering and other (most likely technical) topics that interest me.

See you in my next post!
