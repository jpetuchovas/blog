Yesterday, I got my acceptance letter to Georgia Tech’s [Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). This, coupled with the fact that I had enough time today to set up this blog, nudged me to finally start blogging so that I could share my experience of the OMSCS program in the future. I may also write about my preparation for the program.

I will start studying in January 2020 and most likely specialize in machine learning, taking courses such as [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence), [Computer Vision](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6476-computer-vision), and [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-special-topics-reinforcement-learning). I also believe that it is important to have a good grasp of fundamental computer science topics outside the area of specialization. Being a math major, I haven’t taken classes on operating systems or computer networks, so I intend to take courses that explore these and other foundational topics as well. Expect to see reviews of the courses I take.

Of course, this blog will not just be about OMSCS. I intend to write about machine learning, software engineering, and other (most likely technical) topics that interest me.

See you in my next post!
